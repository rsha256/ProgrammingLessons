# Programming Lessons/Tutorials

This repository containins Team 1923's programming resources. This repo will eventually be moved over to our official organization by forking this repo. 

## Origin

As programming captains for The MidKnight Inventors, we've identified a lack of understanding of how robot code is works among new programmers on the team. Unforunately as a result, new students are barely able to make significant contributions to the robot code and the majority of it is written by the programming leadership. 

## End Goal

In an effort to combat this problem, we are creating a series of documents and tutorials that will teach new students how the WPI Lib works, best practices, and the coding standards for The MidKnight Inventors. Furthermore, we hope that these documents will serve as an on-going collection of knowledge where new and old students will add information based on their experiences.
